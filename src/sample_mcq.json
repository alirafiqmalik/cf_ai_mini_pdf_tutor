		"options": [
			"To compress PDF files",
			"To extract machine-readable text from scanned images",
			"To translate text into multiple languages",
			"To generate summaries of PDF content"
		],
		"correct_option": 1,
		"explanation": "OCR converts scanned images of text into machine-readable text, enabling search and NLP downstream."

		"options": [
			"Recall",
			"Precision",
			"F1 score",
			"MAP (Mean Average Precision)"
		],
		"correct_option": 1,
		"explanation": "Precision = relevant retrieved / total retrieved; it measures exactness of retrieval."

		"question": "You have a passage and four candidate answers. Which technique most directly helps a system choose the best answer by matching semantic meaning rather than exact words?",
		"options": [
			"Bag-of-words matching",
			"Character n-gram overlap",
			"Vector embeddings and cosine similarity",
			"Exact string equality"
		],
		"correct_option": 2,
		"explanation": "Embeddings capture semantic similarity and cosine similarity scores measure closeness in vector space."

			"L1 Regularization"
		],
		"correct_option": 1,
		"explanation": "Cross-entropy (a.k.a. log loss) is commonly used for classification tasks."

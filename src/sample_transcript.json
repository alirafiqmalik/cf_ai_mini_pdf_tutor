        "1": "This page covers fundamental concepts in PDF processing and information retrieval systems. OCR (Optical Character Recognition) is a critical technology that converts scanned images and documents into machine-readable text, enabling digital processing, search, and analysis. This is particularly important for PDF tutoring systems where documents may contain scanned pages. Information retrieval metrics like precision and recall help evaluate system performance. Precision measures how many retrieved results are actually relevant (exactness), while recall measures how many relevant documents were found (completeness). In modern AI systems, semantic matching using vector embeddings has become essential. Unlike simple keyword matching, embeddings represent text as dense vectors in high-dimensional space, allowing systems to understand meaning and context. Cosine similarity between these vectors measures semantic closeness, enabling intelligent question-answering even when exact words don't match. For machine learning classification tasks, cross-entropy loss (also called log loss) serves as the standard objective function, measuring the difference between predicted probability distributions and actual labels.",
        
        "2": "This page explores advanced neural network architectures and text processing techniques. Transformer models have revolutionized natural language processing by introducing self-attention mechanisms that can process entire sequences in parallel, unlike sequential RNNs (Recurrent Neural Networks). This parallel processing dramatically improves training efficiency and enables models to capture long-range dependencies in text. In the context of PDF parsing and document processing, chunking refers to the strategic division of text into meaningful segments such as paragraphs, sections, or sentences. Proper chunking is crucial for retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) systems, as it determines the granularity of information retrieval. Overfitting remains a major challenge in deep learning, where models memorize training data rather than learning generalizable patterns. Dropout is a powerful regularization technique that randomly deactivates neurons during training, forcing the network to learn robust features that don't rely on specific neuron activations. The validation set plays a critical role in model development by providing an independent dataset for hyperparameter tuning and early stopping. Unlike the test set (used only for final evaluation), the validation set guides development decisions while helping detect overfitting during training.",
        
        "3": "This page delves into attention mechanisms and practical considerations for AI systems. Attention mechanisms represent one of the most important innovations in neural networks, allowing models to dynamically focus on relevant parts of input sequences. Instead of treating all input tokens equally, attention computes weights that determine how much each part of the input should influence the output. This selective focusing is crucial for tasks like machine translation, document understanding, and question answering. For evaluation of machine learning models, especially in real-world scenarios with imbalanced classes (where some categories have far more examples than others), accuracy can be misleading. The F1 score provides a balanced metric by computing the harmonic mean of precision and recall, ensuring that both false positives and false negatives are considered. In language model generation, temperature is a hyperparameter that controls output randomness by scaling the probability distribution over vocabulary. Lower temperatures (< 1.0) make the model more deterministic and focused on high-probability tokens, while higher temperatures (> 1.0) increase diversity and creativity by flattening the distribution. Retrieval-augmented generation (RAG) combines the power of large language models with external knowledge retrieval. Instead of relying solely on learned parameters, RAG systems retrieve relevant documents or passages and use them as context for generation. This grounds responses in factual source material, reduces hallucinations, and allows models to access up-to-date information without retraining."
